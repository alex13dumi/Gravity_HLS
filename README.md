# Gravity_HLS
This repository contains a Vivado Vitis HLS project that wants to calculate the Force of two bodies, m1 and m2. 

Prerequisites for running:
* Vitis HLS
* Vivado
* Vitis SDK

This compares the SW vs HW method used for a FPGA. In some cases it is better to use the HW method because the error will be smaller and less resources will be used, but sometimes the time will double/triple (complexity of the application) so we will use the SW method which has less time and a little bit more resources.
