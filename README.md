# Gravity_HLS
This repository contains a Vivado Vitis HLS project that wants to calculate the Force of two bodies, m1 and m2. 
Prerequisites for running the labs:
* Vitis HLS
* Vivado
* Vitis SDK

This compares the SW vs HW method used for interaction of the SOC of an FPGA. In some cases it is better to use the HW method because the error will be smaller and less resources will be used, but sometimes the time will double/triple (complexity of the application) so we will use the SW method which has less time and a little bit more resources.
